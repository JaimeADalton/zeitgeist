The Zeitgeist Engine
--------------------

Zeitgeist is a service that logs the users activities and determines
which files are relevant to one another. It supports simple searching,
filtering by type and mimetype, tagging, etc.

Note that this package only contains the daemon, which you can use
together with several different user interfaces. If you don't know
which to use, try out https://launchpad.net/gnome-zeitgeist/.
